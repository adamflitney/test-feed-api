# Test Feed API
A REST API for a notification feed created as part of a technical test.

Written in NodeJS. The API exposes a single REST endpoint: GET '/userfeed' that returns a JSON object with aggregated notification feed data for a theoretical social website.


## Installation
* Either `git clone` or download and unzip the repository.
* Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
* Set `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 3001).
* Run `node server.js` in the root directory of the project (or use whatever tool you run node programs with).
